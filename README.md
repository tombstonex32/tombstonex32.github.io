  <h1>My Profile</h1>
  <p>This is a profile about myself and my interests in IT as well as where that interest came from and how it developed.</p>
    <h2>Basic information:</h2>
    <p>My name is Tyrell Toomey, I'm a 22 year old aboriginal man with ADHD who was born in Orange NSW at Orange base hospital before it closed down. I lived there for a year before moving to Wee Waa NSW where I currently live. I am currently studying online with RMIT University doing a bachelors of IT. I like to play video games and have played them since I was 5. My favorite genre is First Person Shooter. </p>
    <p> With my results from the Meyers-briggs personality test, I am a INTP-T this means that I am a turbulent logician. Turbulent logicians are introverted, intuitive, thinking, prospecting and turbulent. This means that I prefer a more quiet area like a library as opposed to a dance hall or things of that nature. I am also a tactile learner and learn through more physical means by taking things apart to discover how they work as opposed to the more visual or audio based learners.</p>
    <h3>Interests in IT</h3>
    <p>My interests in IT began from a young age when I was 5. The first time I used my friends PS2 and played games on it I was hooked. From there I learned more about different kinds of technology such as bluetooth, Near Field Communication, wifi and more. The more I learnt about technology and IT the more intrigued I became and in high school I developed an interest in the network admin at thee school and what her job was like. What were the responsibilities of the job and what would someone have to do to that job.</p>
    <p> My interest in IT is to be a network administrator at a high school. It's not as grandiose as what I could aim for but it seems like the best fit for me that I know of right now in the field. Seeing my high school's network admin is what gave me that starting push in that direction, building my own PC and solving problems with it are what strapped the rocket to my back and aimed me towards it.</p>
