  <h1>My Profile</h1>
  <p>This is a profile about myself and my interests in IT as well as where that interest came from and how it developed.</p>
    <h2>Basic information:</h2>
    <p>My name is Tyrell Toomey, I'm a 22 year old aboriginal man with ADHD who was born in Orange NSW at Orange base hospital before it closed down. I lived there for a year before moving to Wee Waa NSW where I currently live. I am currently studying online with RMIT University doing a bachelors of IT. I like to play video games and have played them since I was 5. My favorite genre is First Person Shooter. </p>
    <p> With my results from the Meyers-briggs personality test, I am a INTP-T this means that I am a turbulent logician. Turbulent logicians are introverted, intuitive, thinking, prospecting and turbulent. This means that I prefer a more quiet area like a library as opposed to a dance hall or things of that nature. I am also a tactile learner and learn through more physical means by taking things apart to discover how they work as opposed to the more visual or audio based learners.</p>
    <h2>Interests in IT</h2>
    <p>My interests in IT began from a young age when I was 5. The first time I used my friends PS2 and played games on it I was hooked. From there I learned more about different kinds of technology such as bluetooth, Near Field Communication, wifi and more. The more I learnt about technology and IT the more intrigued I became and in high school I developed an interest in the network admin at thee school and what her job was like. What were the responsibilities of the job and what would someone have to do to that job.</p>
    <p> My interest in IT is to be a network administrator at a high school. It's not as grandiose as what I could aim for but it seems like the best fit for me that I know of right now in the field. Seeing my high school's network admin is what gave me that starting push in that direction, building my own PC and solving problems with it are what strapped the rocket to my back and aimed me towards it.</p>

   <h1>My Project</h1>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>For my project I wish to create a video game that has many popular features in most of the top video games that are currently played today. It would have missions where you use resources that you have gathered and stored in your inventory to create a defence to protect an objective. Different objectives would have different enemies and differing enemy amounts. There would also be missions where you could go, and attack AI controlled bases to gather resources from them. You would use those resources to help strengthen your own bases in other missions. The game would have multiple mission types aside from these and would also feature a permanent upgrade system to help players get stronger and deal with tougher enemies and missions.<p>
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>According to this article from Statista.com there are 3.243 billion people in the world today who play video games.
( https://www.statista.com/statistics/293304/number-video-gamers/#:~:text=In%20total%2C%20there%20were%20an,billion%20gamers%20across%20the%20globe. )</p>   
<p>Creating this video game would be able to provide people with a form of entertainment for them in their free time as well as possibly a community in which they could make and maintain friendships. Video games are one of the most common ways to talk, interact and have fun with friends and strangers over long distances as well as when sitting next to each other on a couch or a bed. They provide a form of interactivity and entertainment that can’t be matched by any other medium and is vast in the variety of genres, themes and styles that can be made and enjoyed.</p>
    <h3>Descriptions</h3>
    <p>The video game that I would like to make would feature many elements such as:</p>
    <h4>Base and Defence Building:</h4>
    <p>Base/Defence building would work in a similar fashion to games like Orcs Must Die 3. Players can place building pieces on a grid layout and path enemies around to a certain place that they would like. If there is an opening in the defence for enemies to go through, then they will travel as far as needed.</p>
    <h4>Resource Gathering</p>
    <p>Players can gather resources from breaking items and objects around the environment as well as collecting them from boxes and from certain higher-level enemies</p>
    <h4>Crafting & Upgrading</h4>
    <p>Players can spend currency and certain materials gained from resource gathering and mission rewards to upgrade weapons, traps and heroes as well as the perks they have.</p>
    <h4>Heroes & Classes</h4>
    <p>Players play as different heroes who are sorted into different classes and have certain benefits towards different gameplay areas. There would be the usual Medic class and Attack class as well as a Harvester class and Constructor class.</p>
    <p>These classes each have their own heroes that you can get from completing certain missions and/or challenges. Different heroes would have different perks that affect an area of play differently but not how the classes would.</p>
    <p>Different heroes of the same class give buffs to a similar cause but by different methods. For example, you would have 2 heroes in the “Attack” class that buff damage that the player deals but one does it through melee weapons while the other would do it through guns.</p>
    <h4>Solo & Co-op Play</h4>
    <p>The game would be able to be played entirely in solo and difficulty scales with the player count. The lobbies can either be private or public and would be able to be joined through an invite if the lobby is private or match making if it is public.</p>
    <h4>Passive Upgrade System</h4>
    <p>Players can spend XP gained from completing missions and killing enemies to upgrade passive buffs to global stats or class specific stats. These buffs would range from damage and health to making certain abilities of a class stronger, last longer and have a shorter cooldown.</p>
    <p>The game would be inspired by Fortnite’s “Save the World” mode and would share similar elements but would go much more in depth with them and provide a more well-rounded and enjoyable experience.</p>
    <p>There would be missions where the player could go and gather resources, kill enemies, defend objectives, retrieve objectives, raid AI controlled bases. The main enemy in these missions and the game overall that the player would encounter would be your standard type of zombie as well as variations and mutations of it.</p>
    <p>There would be your standard zombie that moves at a regular pace and deals low damage, the strength of them would be that they are also found in groups of at least 6 and gain a small buff to their health when near other standard zombies. There would be the usual archetypes of special enemies, but each would have a key weakness to help with dealing with them in a faster way. This would help so they don’t take up so much of the players attention. </p>
    <p>The enemy that the player would face in the Raid missions would be AI controlled survivors who can attack the player with guns and melee weapons. These missions would provide a large amount of resources compared to the missions involving the zombies but would be harder to do as the survivors would be smarter than the zombies.</p>
    <p>I would like to make a game like this as I fell in love with “Save the World”, and it’s features but I was saddened by the lack of proper support and content updates to its end game as well as no ability to start over again without making another Epic account and buying the game again. Being able to make a game like Epic’s but with my own spin and have it properly supported and maintained would be amazing and is what I plan to do. As well as adding other features and changes that I feel would make the game better.</p>
    <p>Listening to community feedback and having an open line of communication with the community would help make sure that I would be taking the right steps in what the game would need to not only stay alive but thrive.</p>
    <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
    <p>The tools and technology needed to make the game would be software such as Epic’s UE5 or the Unity game engine. I would also require a PC to use these game engines or make my own. You can make games without knowing how to code using programs such as “GameMaker Studio 2” but knowledge and skills with multiple programming languages will help with more advanced parts of game development as more expansive games could require multiple languages working together to work. More tools I would need to make use of are forums, websites, reviews and social media to gauge an interest in this kind of game and whether it would be feasible to not only make it but for it to be sustainable for at least 5 years. I would also need these tools to be able to get in contact with artists and other programmers who could help with creating this game.</p>
    <h3>Skills Required</h3>
    <h4>Knowledge of Multiple Programming Languages</h4>
    <p>Knowing multiple programming languages would help with making the engine, scripting AI, scripting cutscenes, scripting triggers for sounds and voice lines.</p>
    <h4>Artwork for Textures, Meshes & Character Designs</h4>
    <p>Without the artwork for the game, it would look very bland as I would have to use free resources for it, or the game would have no textures.</p>
    <h4>Voice Acting</h4>
    <p>While the game can be made with no voice acting in the same style as “The Sims” or “Banjo Kazooie” it would be a better choice to use voice acting. It provides more emotion than just text alone.</p>
    <h4>Storyline Writing</h4>
    <p>Without a proper written storyline, the player can be lost very easily and cannot gain as big of an attachment to the game and its gameplay if the story is bad or poorly written. As John Carmack once said “Story in a game is like story in a porn movie. It’s expected to be there but it’s not important.” So, while the story isn’t necessarily needed for the game to succeed it helps give the player something to grasp onto and guide them through the gameplay.</p>
    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p>The outcome for this project would be a game that people can play with a friend or by themselves and have a good time with it. While it won’t appeal to everyone, as is the nature of people, it should be able to entertain the people that like it. 

It would also provide a community for people to meet others with a similar interest in the game so they at least have that one thing in common and can talk and hang out from there. For the game to have a welcoming and kind community is the ideal outcome for its creation.</p>
